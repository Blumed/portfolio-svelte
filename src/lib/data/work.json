Additionally you can apply a shader as well. This gives you a little peek as to how elements are layering in your window. The chrome extension is constently changing. Give it a shot! I would love your feedback.",

Created a decoupled website that uses google spreadsheets as our CMS. Sveltekit for the frontend and served with Netlify. He lets me know when he has updated some content and press the deploy button in Netlify and boom updated content goes live. All and all it was a super fun project. If you have any need for audio production give him a shout. Super talented guy.",
